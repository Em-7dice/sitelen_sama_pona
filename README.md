# sitelen sama pona
#### A logography for Toki Pona that mimics sitelen pona, but uses only characters already in Unicode.

This is the serious verson of my last project, [sitelen Keme](https://github.com/Em-7dice/stelen-Keme). I genuinely have a need for sitelen pona on my phone and laptop, but alas, it's not part of unicode yet. Hopefully this will change soon. In the meantime, however, we have to make do with what we have. 

Many if not most of the glyphs here are from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/14krrbd/sitelen_pona_in_unicode_all_words/) Reddit post. I have been able to find some more accurate glyphs and have updated some of them (for example, their glyph for ku looks a lot like su, which they couldn't have possibly known 8 months ago.) I may go back and make this list more compatible with theirs; they put a LOT more effort into making sure the list was functional and pretty. I was like halfway through this project when i found the post, so really this whole thing is the result of the sunk cost fallacy. They also didn't give this version of the script a name, which I'm doing so that people can search for this solution easier.

Some of these glyphs were hard to let go of, because unironically, sitelen Keme just has better symbols in some cases. Like, kama and tawa are literally based off of the hieroglyphs. the sitelen Keme for kute is actually an ear. etc.

I've only made the glyphs for the following categories, according to nimi.li as of Feb 2024 :
- core
- widespread
- common
- uncommon

These cover all the words I use, plus some. I'm not that familiar with almost any words more obscure than that. If you'd like to give it a shot, please do! Fork this project or submit a pull req!

\* If you see a question mark in a box, this is the right symbol. I'm not doing a regular question mark for seme because it might be confusing.

# Usage
#### Names

Names are to follow a head noun as usual, and instead of a cartouche, use the following parentheses:
⦅
⦆
If you prefer to use sitelen kalama to write names, use the mid dot for the mora, and this colon for the whole word:
·
⁚
You can use the regular period and the regular colon if you like, I'm not your mom, but these will appear more promanently on the page.

#### Spaces

It's up to you wether or not you place spaces in between glyphs. It saves a lot of space not to, but I prefer it for 2 reasons:
- using a logography over an alphabet already saves you tons of space
- it's a lot more legible, as these glyphs come from vastly different places, and were never meant to be shown next to each other in this way.
